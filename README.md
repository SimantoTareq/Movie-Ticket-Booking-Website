# Project Description:  
 
 
 
 
Hiring a maid or driver could soon get more complicated. The householder and car owner may
have to issue an appointment letter that clearly lists the terms and conditions of employment. So
we will going to make a review website for about it. Here the visitors can see the review and the
information of the drivers and maids and they can recruit them through the website. And the
user can give review about their maids and drivers. There will be an interface for users and
driver and maids. User can add details about them and user can particularly search for any
driver and maids by their name. There will be two different sections for maids and drivers for
simple user experience. And in the worker section the drivers and maids can add their basic
information. For using this website people first have to create their profile and then they can use
it. Then they will have to fill up every section of the information that required in the website then
after creating the website user will see a new page and there they will see two sections about
driver and maids. For driver user have to put the destination and search it. And for maids they
have to put the area where they wants the maids to work. And for worker they also need to log
in and for creating the website they need to fill up information sections. And then another
window will appear. They have to choose driver and maids section. And then they have to select
their area where they want to work. Basically this is how the website will work. And we don’t
know more about the project yet. If it get select then will research furthermore. And hopefully will
able to create a fine project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For making this website we will probably use htlm, css, Bootstrap, php, sql.
